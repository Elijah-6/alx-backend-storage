## What is NoSQL?

NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL" and represents a class of databases that don't use the traditional table-based, relational database model. Instead, NoSQL databases store data in various formats such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores. This flexibility allows NoSQL to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data efficiently.

## Differences Between SQL and NoSQL

| Feature                  | SQL Databases (Relational)                     | NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational)      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Data Structure**        | Tables with rows and columns (schema-based)    | Various (documents, key-value, graphs, etc.) |
| **Relationships**         | Uses foreign keys and joins                   | Avoids complex relationships          |
| **Query Language**        | SQL                                            | Varies (MongoDB uses JSON-like syntax)|
| **Transaction Support**   | Supports ACID transactions                     | Often uses eventual consistency       |
| **Scalability**           | Vertical scaling                               | Horizontal scaling                    |
| **Examples**              | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite                      | MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis             |

## ACID Properties

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, and it ensures the reliability of transactions in databases:

- **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing.
- **Consistency**: Data remains in a valid state before and after a transaction.
- **Isolation**: Multiple transactions can occur concurrently without affecting each other.
- **Durability**: Committed transactions are saved, even if the system crashes.

## What is Document Storage?

In NoSQL document stores, data is stored as documents (usually in JSON, BSON, or XML formats). Each document contains key-value pairs and can have a flexible schema, allowing different fields and structures for different documents within the same collection. MongoDB is an example of a document store.

---

## Types of NoSQL Databases

1. **Document Stores**: Stores data as documents (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB).
2. **Key-Value Stores**: Stores data as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB).
3. **Column Stores**: Organizes data in columns instead of rows (e.g., Cassandra, HBase).
4. **Graph Databases**: Represents data in nodes and edges, emphasizing relationships (e.g., Neo4j).

## Benefits of NoSQL Databases

- **Schema Flexibility**: Schema-less design allows dynamic data storage.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Easily scales by distributing data across multiple servers.
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast read/write operations, especially with large datasets.
- **Big Data Handling**: Well-suited for managing unstructured or semi-structured data.
- **Availability**: Focus on high availability with eventual consistency, especially in distributed systems.
